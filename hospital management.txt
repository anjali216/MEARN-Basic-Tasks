ðŸš€ Welcome to the Project Demo of the MERN Stack Hospital Management System!

In this section, we'll walk you through a comprehensive demo of the Hospital Management System (HMS) built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. This demo will give you a clear understanding of the system's functionalities, user interfaces, and overall workflow. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this walkthrough will help you visualize the end product and inspire you to build your own professional-grade HMS.
